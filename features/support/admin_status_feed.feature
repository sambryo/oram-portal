Feature: ORAM Employee checking the status of clients via the status feed.
  As an ORAM administrator
  I want to be able to see a status feed on the landing page that displays the status of all referrers and prospective clients.

Background: Logging is an an Admin to check statuses
  Given that I am logged in as the following referrer:
    | first_name	| last_name	| email             	| password	| invitation_accepted_at | role        |
    | Central	    | Admin       | central@admin.com   | password	| 'test'               | employee    |

  Given the following clients exist:
    | first_name  | last_name   | email                 | password     	  | role			    | invitation_accepted_at | status   |
    | Bryan       | Adams     	| bryan@adams.com       | oram123         | referrer	    | 'test'                 | Approved |
    | George      | Clooney     | george@clooney.com    | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | Approved |
    | Michael     | Jordan    	| michael@jordan.com    | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | Rejected |
    | Joe         | Bob        	| joe@bob.com           | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | Approved |
