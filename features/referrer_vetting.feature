Feature: Vetting a Referrer
	As an ORAM administrator
	In order to vet referrers
	I should be able to view referrer profiles and approve or reject their profile request

Background: referrers in the database

	Given the following referrers exist:
	    | first_name	| last_name	| email             	| password	| invitation_accepted_at |
	 	  | Bryan			  | Adams     | bryan@adams.com		  | oram123	  | 'test' |
	 	  | Hannah		  | Montana   | hannah@montana.com	| oram123	  | 'test' |

	  	| Donald		  | Trump		  | donald@trump.com		| oram123	  | 'test' |

	And I am logged in as the following admin:
