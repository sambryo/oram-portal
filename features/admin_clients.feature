Feature: Administrator viewing client profiles and being able to approve/reject them
  As an ORAM administrator
  In order to mark client refugees statuses as approved, rejected, or incomplete
  I want to be able to see a table of all clients and be able to view their individual profiles

Background: Clients in the database and logged in as an admin
  Given the following clients exist:
    | first_name  | last_name   | email                 | password     	  | role					| invitation_accepted_at | phase    |
    | Bryan       | Adams     	| bryan@adams.com       | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | "Phase 1"|
    | George      | Clooney     | george@clooney.com    | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | "Phase 3"|
    | Michael     | Jordan    	| michael@jordan.com    | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | "Phase 4"|
    | Joe         | Bob     	  | joe@bob.com           | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | "Phase 5"|

  And I am logged in as the following admin:

    | oram        | admin     | admin321@gmail.com  | oramadmin  | employee |
